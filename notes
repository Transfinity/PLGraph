    Cobol
        10/16: There seem to be two mainstream implementations of cobol for unix: open cobol and tiny cobol.  Both are written in c and use a yacc-based parser, but only open cobol will compile without issue.  Potential for within-language comparison.

    JavaScript
        10/16: JS is owned by Mozilla.  I can't find a yacc parser, but there are plenty of grammar specifications available (http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1153976512034/ecmascriptA3.g, http://hepunx.rl.ac.uk/~adye/jsspec11/llr.htm).  Firefox's JS interpreter is called spidermonkey, but doesn't use yacc

    There does not appear to be a yacc grammar available for python - it looks like making the indentation levels significant is tricky within the context of yacc.  I will save this for later.

    From the internet (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Software_Engineers_Handbook/Language_Dictionary/COBOL#General_Syntax): "the syntax (like other early languages, including FORTRAN) is not designed to follow a formal grammar; for this reason COBOL and FORTRAN parsers are rarely implemented using automatic code generators"
    Fortran plugin for gcc should be in the basic gcc package (on the home pc).  We'll see

    It looks like Antlr uses LL(1) grammars, wheras YACC/Bison use LALR grammars.  As such, I would not expect a .y file to work for antlr, or a .g file to work with bison.  It might eventually be interesting to look at the difference between the same language implemented in different ways, but for now I'm not going to bother with antlr - it only adds another variable.

PLGraph current goals:

Right now, it's all about the statistics.

I don't really know what I need to know, is the thing.  How can I decide what tests to run?  Well, that's what the hypothesis is for.  You say, I expect that we'll see this, because this, and then you test to see whether or not you see that.

And right now I don't have a hypothesis.  Which is partly because I don't know the data, but it's partly because I don't know what I want to know.

So the question is: is there any useful information contained in the transition graph of a language?  How does the high-level design of the language affect the graphs, and (eventually) how does this change the compiler.  And perhaps most importantly, is there more variation between different languages than there is between different implementations of the same language?

    I experimented with removing all the semantic actions from the .y file.  This produces a perfectly usable file that bison is able to read and turn into a PLgraph.
    One tricky bit is the semantic actions add dummy nodes to the graph.  These are obviously implementation dependant.  Still, they might qualify as important.  I think the thing to do would be to remove ALL semantic actions from all of the yacc files, just to get some consistancy.
    In order to remove said SAs, I used vim's search and replace feature, with the command 
    :%s/\([^`']\){\_[^}{]*}/\1/gc
    This searches for all closed brackt segments, not proceeded by a tick or backtick, with no interior blocks.  Pretty cool, I know.  Before you use it, you have to remove all the junk at the top and bottom of the file, basically everything but the token definitions (which are required).
